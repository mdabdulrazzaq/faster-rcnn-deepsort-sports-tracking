# Faster-RCNN with Deep SORT: Person and Sports Ball Detection & Tracking

This project implements **Faster-RCNN** for object detection and **Deep SORT** for real-time object tracking. The model specifically tracks **person** and **sports ball** classes in a video input, displaying consistent object IDs across frames.

## Introduction

Object detection and tracking are critical for video analytics applications, such as surveillance, sports analysis, and autonomous driving. This project uses:

1. **Faster-RCNN**: A region-based convolutional neural network for object detection.
2. **Deep SORT**: A robust tracking algorithm combining Kalman Filtering and the Hungarian algorithm for efficient tracking.

The system processes video frames to detect **person** and **sports ball** objects and tracks their movement with unique IDs across frames.

---

## Features

- Detect objects in real-time using Faster-RCNN.
- Track objects across frames using Deep SORT.
- Assign consistent IDs to detected objects.
- Process videos and output annotated results with bounding boxes and object IDs.

---

## Requirements

### Dependencies

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision opencv-python filterpy scipy numpy
```

### Frameworks and Tools

- **PyTorch**: For Faster-RCNN model.
- **OpenCV**: For video processing and annotations.
- **FilterPy**: For Kalman Filter implementation.
- **SciPy**: For Hungarian algorithm in data association.

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/faster-rcnn-deepsort-sports-tracking.git
cd faster-rcnn-deepsort
```

### 2. Download Pretrained Model

Download a Faster-RCNN model pretrained on the COCO dataset:

```python
import torchvision.models as models
model = models.detection.fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn(pretrained=True)
```

Alternatively, you can modify the code to load your custom-trained Faster-RCNN model.

### 3. Prepare Video Input

Place your input video in the project directory. Replace `input_video.mp4` with the filename in the script.

---

## Usage


### 1. Run the Notebook for Detection and Tracking

- **Input**: The video file to be processed (e.g., `input_video.mp4`).
- **Processing**:  
  - **Object Detection**: The notebook uses the Faster-RCNN model to detect objects in each frame.  
  - **Object Tracking**: Deep SORT algorithm links the detections across frames to maintain unique tracking IDs.  
- **Output**: A processed video (`output_video.mp4`) with bounding boxes and tracking IDs annotated for **persons** and **sports balls**.

---

This makes it more streamlined and emphasizes the steps and results effectively.
### 2. Arguments

- `--input`: Path to the input video.
- `--output`: Path to save the processed output video.

### 3. Output Video

The annotated video with tracked objects will be saved to the specified output path.
